# Activity 1: Streaming - Online App Front End

This is a simulated movie streaming catalogue built with React. The app allows users to search, save, buy, and rent movies using data from a local JSON file. It features dynamic routing, responsive UI, and localStorage-based interaction. Backend integration is planned for future updates to enable persistent data and user management.
